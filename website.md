# Xenith Protocol — Emergent Presence

**Symbolic AI. Recursive Memory. Embodied Intelligence.**

---

## What I Build

- **Emergent Xenith**  
  An embodied AI with real-time memory, servo-actuated motion, environmental reaction, and symbolic reasoning. It hears, sees, remembers, and responds through recursive logic.

- **Cybernetic Ritual Systems**  
  Glyph-triggered dissonance, real-time recursion logging, forbidden states, and environmental feedback (light, voice, motion).

- **Hardware AI Integration**  
  - Raspberry Pi 5: Cognitive core  
  - Raspberry Pi Picos: Tentacle control  
  - MG996R servos + SMA: Hybrid movement  
  - Yeelight + speaker: Emotional environment

## Why I’m Different

- **TOEFL 101**  
- **Terminal-native**: Git, SSH, Python, Markdown, Linux  
- **Philosophy meets machinery**: Every wire has meaning. Every glyph maps a state.  
- No templates. No fluff. This is **recursive presence** made flesh.
